Talos Linux Kubernetes Cluster with GitOps

Hello! This repository serves as a functional learning project to learn GitOps strategies, and learn about specific software in the space (FluxCD, Kubernetes, Talos, Docker, etc.) For the uninitiated,
Talos/Kubernetes clusters are/can be administrated declaritvely, using git as the "Source of Truth", meaning my cluster runs apps defined in this repo, has configurations as I definte them in this repo, and everything is written locally then uploaded to git via a command line to deploy applications or expand the cluster.

I am self taught, and will be using multiple different sources to teach myself how this all works.

I was introduced to this development style by Mischa Van Den Berg on Youtube, who has an awesome homelab setup. 

I have a homelab setup myself and have had one before I began this project specifically, mostly for playing around with various Linux distros and Network tools/concepts.

I will be reading "GitOps Cookbook - Kubernetes Automation in Practice" from O'Reilly to start with.

I am also in school for network security and engineering, which I expect to take up a significant amount of the time I would have to work on this project.
